# Task Management App

A full-stack task management application with web. Built with modern technologies and designed for real-time collaboration, intuitive UI, and role-based access control.

# Important note

To ensure safety and better version control, I initially worked on a private draft repository where I managed issues and committed code incrementally.
However, due to time constraints, the final submitted project is a copied version from that draft repo (I didnâ€™t have time to clean and push a new version â€” that's a stupid decision).

If youâ€™d like to review the original commit history, please accept the invitation to that private repository.
Iâ€™ve sent the git repo through my submission email

## Project Overview

This project is a task management system supporting:

- User registration and authentication (sign up, login, logout)
- Users can create, update, and delete their own tasks
- Role-based access (Admin/User)
- Realtime search with debounce
- Inline editing
- Status-based task grouping and update
- Theme toggling (Dark/Light)
- Responsive UI (Web-first, mobile-adaptive)

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

- Instead of toggling task status with a select box, I used **stepwise status display (Todo â†’ In Progress â†’ Done)** for intuitive interaction. Users simply click to advance status.
- Editing is done directly on the task card via a `FlexibleInput` component that switches between `<p>` and `<input>`, allowing seamless inline editing.
- **Only admins** can promote others to admin or delete tasks globally.
- Implemented **realtime search with debounce (800ms)** to enhance performance and user experience.
- **Drag-and-drop not yet implemented**, but planned as next improvement.
- Includes **theme toggling** using `shadcn/ui` components.
- Due to time constraints, the **task modal form was assisted by AI** for initial structure, then refined manually.
- After submitting this test, I'll continue to research for CI/CD, websocket subject to apply to this project
